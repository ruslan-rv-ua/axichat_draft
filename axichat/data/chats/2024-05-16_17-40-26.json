However, if you want to display HTML content within your own application without using any framework, you would typically use a web view control provided by a framework like Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython.\n\nIf you want to avoid using any framework and just use Python's standard library, you can use the `os` module to open the default web browser with the HTML content as a file. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport tempfile\n\ndef view_html_in_browser(html_content):\n    # Create a temporary file to hold the HTML content\n    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.html') as temp_file:\n        # Write the HTML content to the temporary file\n        temp_file.write(html_content.encode('utf-8'))\n        temp_file.flush()\n        # Get the path to the temporary file\n        file_path = temp_file.name\n    \n    # Open the file in the default web browser\n    os.startfile(file_path)  # This will use the default application for .html files\n\n# Example usage:\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Page Title</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>\n    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\"\"\"\nview_html_in_browser(html_content)\n```\n\nThis code will create a temporary HTML file, write the provided HTML content to it, and then open the file in the default web browser.\n\nPlease note that this approach has limitations:\n- The HTML content must be self-contained and cannot reference external resources.\n- The user must have a web browser installed that can handle `.html` files.\n- The temporary file will not be deleted automatically after the browser has opened it, so you may want to add cleanup code to handle this.\n\nIf you need more advanced features or a more integrated solution, you might want to consider using a web view control provided by a framework like Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython. These frameworks provide components that can render HTML content within a window in your application."}]}
